I consider myself "Formerly Technical" so if you're here to look at my code, know it's all VERY OLD!

I'm a graduate of LEARN Academy (Bravo 2020 Cohort!) and I use my firsthand knowledge of the LEARN curriculum and program to connect with tech company partners, securing internship opportunities for our students. I've brought on over 25 new partners to our program, successfully onboarding them and helping manage their first tech internships on our team. If you have openings for full-stack web-dev interns at your company, let's talk!

I'm a key member of our Career Services team, coaching and guiding students in their job search. I provide students and alumni with rÃ©sumÃ© reviews, LinkedIn coaching, portfolio assessments, and application help. I've worked with over 200 students and love hearing the news that someone has received an offer letter.
